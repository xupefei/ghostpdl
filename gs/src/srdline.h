/*
 * Read a line from s_in, starting at index *pcount in buf.  Start by
 * printing prompt on s_out.  If the string is longer than size - 1 (we need
 * 1 extra byte at the end for a null or an EOL), use bufmem to reallocate
 * buf; if bufmem is NULL, just return 1.  In any case, store in *pcount the
 * first unused index in buf.  *pin_eol is normally false; it should be set
 * to true (and true should be recognized) to indicate that the last
 * character read was a ^M, which should cause a following ^J to be
 * discarded.  is_stdin(s) returns true iff s is stdin: this is needed for
 * an obscure condition in the default implementation.
